    <h1 align="center"> Hi, I'm Cristian </h1>
    <h3 align="center">
        I'm passionate about leveraging programming to solve real-world problems. With a strong background in mathematics and econometrics, I bring a quantitative edge to my analyses while ensuring attention to detail in data visualization and effective communication of insights. Currently, I work at the Ministry of Education and am completing a masterâ€™s degree at Universidad Torcuato Di Tella in Buenos Aires, Argentina. My experience includes programming in R and Python for data analysis and statistical modeling, and Iâ€™m now expanding my skills in Java and C++, particularly for video game development.

    <h3 align="center">
        I'm excited about building and collaborating on projects that are not only technically solid but also intuitive and visually engaging. Always open to new ideas and challengesâ€”letâ€™s connect!
